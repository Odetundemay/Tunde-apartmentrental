# Luxury Stays - Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Sanity Account**: Create a free account at [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io)
2. **Vercel Account**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. **GitHub Account**: For version control and deployment

## Step 1: Setup Sanity CMS

### Create a Sanity Project

1. Go to [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io) and create a new project
2. Choose "Structured Content" as your project type
3. Select a dataset (e.g., "production")
4. Note your **Project ID** and **Dataset name**

### Add Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

\`\`\`env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
\`\`\`

### Deploy Sanity Studio

\`\`\`bash
npm run sanity -- deploy
\`\`\`

This will deploy your Sanity Studio to a unique URL where you can manage your content.

## Step 2: Add Sample Data to Sanity

1. Go to your Sanity Studio URL
2. Create a new "Apartment" document
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: e.g., "Luxury Downtown Loft"
   - **Location**: e.g., "Downtown, City"
   - **Price Per Night**: e.g., 250
   - **Bedrooms**: e.g., 2
   - **Description**: Add a detailed description
   - **Amenities**: Add amenities like "WiFi", "TV", "Coffee Maker", "AC"
   - **Images**: Upload apartment photos
   - **Featured**: Toggle to true for featured apartments
   - **Availability**: Add date ranges for booking availability

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Using GitHub (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub:
   \`\`\`bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/luxury-stays.git
   git push -u origin main
   \`\`\`

2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sanity project ID
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`: Your dataset name (e.g., "production")
5. Click "Deploy"

### Option B: Using Vercel CLI

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
\`\`\`

Follow the prompts and add your environment variables when asked.

## Step 4: Configure CORS in Sanity

1. Go to your Sanity project settings
2. Navigate to "API" â†’ "CORS origins"
3. Add your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
4. Also add `http://localhost:3000` for local development

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel deployment URL
2. Check that:
   - Home page loads with featured apartments
   - Apartments listing page displays all apartments
   - Filters work correctly
   - Apartment detail pages load with images and booking calendar

## Troubleshooting
